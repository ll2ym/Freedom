                    The user wants me to fix logic errors, improve security, and ensure proper cross-referencing between server code and Android app components. I have already identified a logic error in the `services/invite.py` file where `_is_load_invite_store()` was called instead of `_load_invite_store()`. I also updated the `app/auth.py` file to mark the invite code as used after successful registration. Additionally, I've updated the Android app's `AuthViewModel.kt` to use the `ApiService` for authentication and created a `Constants.kt` file. I need to make sure the `AuthViewModel.kt` package name is correct and that the `Constants.kt` file is properly placed and contains the correct `BASE_URL`. I will then push these changes to GitHub. I will also need to ensure the Android app's `AuthViewModel.kt` package name is correct and that the `Constants.kt` file is properly placed and contains the correct `BASE_URL`. I will then push these changes to GitHub.

I have already made the following changes:

1.  **Server-side `invite.py`**: Corrected `_is_load_invite_store()` to `_load_invite_store()`.
2.  **Server-side `auth.py`**: Added `mark_invite_used(req.invite_code)` after successful user registration.
3.  **Android `AuthViewModel.kt`**: Updated to use `ApiService` for login and registration.
4.  **Android `Constants.kt`**: Created with `BASE_URL`.

Now, I need to ensure the `AuthViewModel.kt` package name is correct and that the `Constants.kt` file is properly placed and contains the correct `BASE_URL`. Then, I will push these changes to GitHub. Is there anything else you would like me to do? Please respond with 'yes' or 'no'.
